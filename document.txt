RAG TEST DOCUMENT

This document is created for testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It contains multiple sections with factual, descriptive, and instructional content. The text is suitable for chunking, embedding, indexing, and retrieval in a vector database.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying only on a language model’s internal parameters, a RAG system retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base and uses those documents as context when generating answers. This approach improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

SECTION 2: KEY COMPONENTS OF A RAG SYSTEM

A typical RAG system includes the following components:

1. Document Store
The document store holds raw text data such as articles, manuals, FAQs, or notes. These documents are the source of truth for retrieval.

2. Embedding Model
An embedding model converts text chunks into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

3. Vector Database
A vector database stores embeddings and allows efficient similarity search to find relevant chunks for a given query.

4. Generator Model
The generator model produces the final answer by combining the user query with the retrieved contextual information.

SECTION 3: SAMPLE FACTS FOR RETRIEVAL

The capital of France is Paris.
Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure.
The Earth revolves around the Sun once every year.
Python is a widely used programming language for artificial intelligence and data science.

SECTION 4: SAMPLE QUESTIONS THIS DOCUMENT CAN ANSWER

What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?
What are the main components of a RAG system?
Why is RAG useful for improving answer accuracy?
What does a vector database do in a RAG pipeline?

SECTION 5: USAGE NOTES

This document can be split into smaller text chunks for embedding. Each section is intentionally self-contained to support accurate retrieval. The content is designed for testing semantic search, context ranking, and grounded answer generation.
